Final Lab:

1) What is the purpose of this Git repository?
	- The repository is used to store and revise web projects while giving other people access to view my projects.

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	- My favorite was assignment 2 because using an api and reading api documentations really helped me to be a better programmer/learner. Truthfully, using google maps api was super cool.

3) How much do you think oyu have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	- I learned SO much over the course of the semester. I have always wanted to start my own projects, but I simply didn't know where to start. After taking this course I think I now have both the basic knowledge of web programming and the ability and motivation to learn on my own.


4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course?
	- The most important thing I learned is to work and collaborate with peers. Without discussing and learning together with my peers, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the class as much as I do now. Some fun examples include hacking other people's code through XSS while laughing at creative injection ideas. Another is struggling to use express and node js to create a server together with a friend.


5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	- I would love to learn more about frameworks including Angular JS and React.
